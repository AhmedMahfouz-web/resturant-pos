# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing restaurant POS system to provide comprehensive inventory management, recipe costing, and real-time stock tracking. The enhanced system will build upon the current Laravel-based POS system to provide better inventory control, automated stock adjustments, recipe-based costing, and improved reporting capabilities.

The system will maintain all existing functionality while adding advanced inventory features including automated stock level monitoring, expiry date tracking, supplier management, batch/lot tracking, and comprehensive cost analysis using FIFO methodology.
